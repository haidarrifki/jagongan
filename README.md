## Introduction
"Jagongan" is a Javanese slang term which has its roots in the word "jagong", meaning "to keep company" or "hang out". This project is where your codebase can interact and have a good time. It's a place where your code comes to hang out, have a good time, and maybe do a little work.

## Features
- A whole heap of TypeScript goodness, because who doesn't love static types?
- A dash of `langchain` for when you're feeling linguistic.
- `@supabase/supabase-js` for those times when you need a little more database in your life.
- And let's not forget our good friends `chalk`, because we all need a little color and environment in our lives.
