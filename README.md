"Jagongan" is a Javanese slang term which has its roots in the word "jagong", meaning "to keep company" or "hang out". Here you can interact or talk anything with your codebase like it's your besties. It's a place where your code comes to hang out, have a good time, and maybe do a little work.

## What's in the box?

Well, I'm glad you asked! We've got:

- A whole heap of TypeScript goodness, because who doesn't love static types?
- A dash of `langchain` for when you're feeling linguistic.
- `@supabase/supabase-js` for those times when you need a little more database in your life.
- And let's not forget our good friends `chalk` and `dotenv`, because we all need a little color and environment in our lives.

## How do I get this party started?

Well, it's pretty simple. We've got scripts for all occasions:

- Feeling dev-ish? `pnpm run dev`
- Want to build something? `pnpm run build`
- Just want to start? `pnpm run start`
- Feeling messy? `pnpm run lint`
- Messed up and want to fix it? `pnpm run lint:fix`
- Want to make things pretty? `pnpm run format`
- Want to check if things are pretty? `pnpm run format:check`

## Anything else?

You bet! We've got a handy little binary called `jagongan` that you can use. It's like having a little piece of this project in your pocket.

## Who's responsible for this?

That would be the one and only Muhammad Haidar Rifki. You can reach him at haidarrfki@gmail.com. He's pretty cool.

## What's the license?

This project is licensed under the MIT license. So you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. Just don't say we didn't warn you.

## Keywords

Because everyone loves buzzwords: langchain, starter, template, node, typescript, llm.

So come on in, the water's fine! Welcome to Jagongan, where your code can hang loose and still get stuff done.
